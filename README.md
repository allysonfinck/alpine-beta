### User Stories

A user can simply browse through the hikes database without signing up, but cannot create, edit or delete pages. This user can view hike information including images and maps. The sign up and login buttons are visible for this user.

A user that is signed in to the application can view all hikes and see specific pages, but can also create, edit and delete hike pages. Since the user is logged in, the signup and login paths go away and a logout button is visible, which redirects back to the homepage.

### Future Updates

Community page will show users profile pages in grid style with images and usernames.

Map data will be generated with MySQL database and Angular data rendering, connecting to the Google Database instead of requiring specific coordinates.

Users can comment on hikes created by other users and view them on same page. Comments will display below hike information section, and "Add a Comment" modal will appear as a post route.

Search bar will enable users to search by location, name etc. to find specific trails.
